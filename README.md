# Python Music Teacher

## Description

A Python package for teaching music theory and note knowledge.

It is designed to allow the user to practice note recognition and music theory in a fun and interactive way. <br>
The user selects a song file and the program will ask the user to sing the notes of the song during the playback. <br>
A headset is recommended as the program will listen to the user's voice and compare it to the song's notes. <br>
The program will then give the user feedback on how well they did and show them realtime how their voice compares to the song's notes. <br>
